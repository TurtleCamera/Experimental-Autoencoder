# Experimental-Autoencoder
Another side project for fun - attempting to create an autoencoder Minecraft server plugin to try to compress our chat history. This plugin is currently incomplete and not worked on at the moment. Once again, major props to Albert Jean (albertsjean) for introducing me to plugin development.
